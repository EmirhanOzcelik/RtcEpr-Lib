This library provides easy-to-use time management features and persistent storage using EEPROM. It contains two main classes:

- **\_\_zaman** â€” Handles time tracking and EEPROM-based calendar settings  
- **\_\_epr** â€” Provides low-level EEPROM read/write operations

Includes convenient macros for consistent and formatted time string output.
